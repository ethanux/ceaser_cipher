# Caesar Cipher

This Python script implements the Caesar cipher, a substitution cipher used for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Description

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to communicate with his generals.
